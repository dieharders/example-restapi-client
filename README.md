# Angular6 Web Client

This is an example of a front-end (Angular6) communicating with a back-end API to retrieve data locally stored on the back-end server. This data holds directory information on superheroes that can be edited or added to by the web client. 

## Angular Version

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Live Deployment

This project is already setup for deployment to Heroku. All you must do is set an ENV variable for the host provider's (Heroku) port in `server.js`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
